# Hi there 👋 I'm Iliyan
I'm finishing my Master Degree in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin, so for the moment I'm a student :)
## 🧑🏻‍💻 About me and my past
I still remember the first time I was introduced to a computer. I was about 6 or 7 years old (so it must have been around 2008/2009), playing Need For Speed Underground 2 on an old Acer laptop from my uncle, when I first touched a computer keyboard. From that moment, like most “computer guys,” I think, I’ve never really been apart from that little box 💻.

As time went by, I wasn’t just playing video games anymore (well, I was still downloading them in a… questionable way 😅, but that’s another story). I also started surfing the web, creating accounts on different social networks (I still remember the old Facebook 🥲), and keeping in touch with my relatives through Skype. For a 10-year-old, doing all this on a computer felt like using a magic box that could satisfy every whim and request ✨.

At 14, I decided to enroll in a technical high school — here in Italy we call it an *Istituto Tecnico* — because I wanted to go beyond what a computer does visually. I wanted to understand how and why we’ve come to rely so heavily on them.

By 19, I had earned my high school diploma in ICT, which gave me a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, basic operating system concepts, computer networks, and internet technologies. Still hungry for knowledge, I enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Turin, graduating in November 2024 🎓.

Now, I’m embarking on the final year of my Master’s degree in Computer Engineering (in Italy, the Master’s lasts two years), eager to deepen my understanding and continue exploring the world of technology 🚀.
## 😎 Interests and Hobbies
The tech fields I’m most passionate about are cloud computing, programming, and distributed systems—especially understanding their inner workings and developing their functionalities. I also love the challenge of building full-stack applications from scratch. On top of that, I must confess I have a soft spot for computer networks 🌐, from small local setups all the way to the massive infrastructure of the internet and its engineering.

That said, I don’t spend all my free time buried in “nerdy stuff” 😆. I’m also strongly committed to sports and fitness. I usually train three times per week doing bodyweight exercises, and whenever I get the chance, I enjoy hiking in the beautiful Italian Alps 🏔️. As for video games, I don’t really play them anymore 🥲, but they still hold a special place in my heart as some of my sweetest childhood memories 🎮.
